# ECMA-48 in searchable, copy-n-pastable form

[ECMA-48](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm) is
the freely available standard that defines *ANSI Escape Sequences*.  The text
in ECMA-48 is identical to the corresponding ANSI standard but is made freely
available via the ECMA website whereas the ANSI standard requires fees to access.

ECMA-48 was last revised in 1979 and the currently available digital representation
of the standard is a scan of a hard copy document from that time, and that makes
it difficult to search and link into.

I (@wez) took it upon myself to OCR and transcribe this document into markdown
to open things up a bit.  I need this documentation as part of my effort in
building terminal emulation software.
