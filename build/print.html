<h2><a class="header" href="#brief-history" id="brief-history">BRIEF HISTORY</a></h2>
<p>After having issued its Standard ECMA-35 for the extension of the 7-bit coded
character set, the coding committee TC 1 of ECMA set up a task group with a
view to developing a set of additional control functions. This work was
conducted in close co-operation with the coding committee X3L2 of ANSI.
Intermediate results were periodically discussed at the meetings of
I1SO/TC97/SC2. The first edition of Standard ECMA-48 was issued in September
1976.</p>
<p>In ISO/TC97/SC2 a working party developed an ISO Draft Proposal based on
ECMA-48 and on the contributions presented by the representatives of X3L2.
Several versions were drafted, submitted to SC2 and up-dated according to the
comments received. Finally, at its May 1978 meeting, SC2 adopted the final text
which will be processed as a draft international standard and eventually issued
as ISO 6429.</p>
<p>This 2nd edition of ECMA-48 is based on the text of DIS 6429 and is technically
identical with it. It has been accepted as an ECMA Standard by the General
Assembly of ECMA on June 21, 1979.</p>
<p>THIS 2nd EDITION SUPERSEDES THE VERSION DATED SEPTEMBER 1976.</p>
<p><em>This</em> version was converted to markdown in June 2019 by Wez Furlong and
contains some formatting deviations from the scanned PDF of the original
document from 1979 to make it render in a more appealing way. There may be a
few OCR transcription issues.  Aside from the format/layout adjustments
required to bring this document to a searchable and linkable form, there are no
intentional textual changes.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1-general" id="1-general">1. GENERAL</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#11-scope-and-field-of-application" id="11-scope-and-field-of-application">1.1. Scope and Field of Application</a></h3>
<p>This Standard defines additional control functions for use in an extended 7-bit
or 8-bit code structured in accordance with Standard ECMA-35. It comprises a C1
set, control functions derived therefrom and four single control functions.</p>
<p>These control functions are intended to be used, in combination with the CO set
defined in Standard ECMA-6, for data interchange with character-imaging
devices.</p>
<p>A character-imaging device is a device which is capable of re ceiving a data
stream that consists of coded control functions and graphics, and of producing
character image output, i.e.  output that can be read by a human being. The
character image output is, in general, produced in the form of one or more
rectangular arrays of characters which are called pages.</p>
<p>If the device is an input/output device rather than merely an output device, it
is also capable of transmitting a data stream that consists of coded control
functions and graphics; the transmitted data stream is, in general, composed of
a combination of data which have been sent to the device and data which have
been locally entered into the device, e.g. by an associated keyboard.</p>
<p>The control functions are defined by their effects on a character-imaging
input/output device. It is, therefore, necessary to make certain assumptions
about the device architecture.  These assumptions are as little restrictive as
possible; they are specified in 5, DEVICE CONCEPTS.</p>
<p>The intention of this Standard is to facilitate data interchange, not to
standardize equipment. The specifications of the architectural device concepts
are included only to delimit the field of application of the Standard. The
definitions of the control functions may not be applicable to devices which do
not conform to the specified concepts.</p>
<p>The structure of this Standard is open-ended, so that more control functions
can be included in future versions.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#12-conformance" id="12-conformance">1.2. Conformance</a></h3>
<p>Full conformance to a standard means that all its requirements are met. For
such conformance to be unique the standard must contain no options. This is
typically the case for hardware standards, for instance Standard ECMA-10 for
data interchange on punched tapes.</p>
<p>This Standard ECMA-48 is of a different nature and as a result, it is only
practicable to envisage limited conformance to it, as defined hereunder.</p>
<p>This Standard addresses a whole class of devices which can vary greatly from
each other depending on the application for which a device has been
specifically designed. Obviously, a product which implements all facilities
described in this standard - thus being in &quot;full conformance&quot; with it - whilst
theoretically possible, would be technically and economically unthinkable.</p>
<p>Under limited conformance the following is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The general architecture of the device shall be as described in Section 5S.
This section includes many features not all of which need be implemented. The
selection made in practice will depend on the applications envisaged.</li>
<li>The device may implement other modes than those described in the Standard,
but these shall not be incompatible with those described in the Standard.</li>
<li>The device shall implement control functions described in Section 7 with
the same definition and the same coding. It shall not implement other controls
which are incompatible with those definitions.</li>
<li>If in addition facilities not provided by the Standard are required they
shall be implemented only by means of private use codes, they may not be coded
elsewhere. Facilities provided by the Standard may not be implemented by means
of such private use codes.</li>
<li>Where a default value of a parameter is specified in the Standard for a
given control function a conforming implementation of this control function has
to be capable of meeting the default situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recognized that limited conformance does not ensure necessarily that two
devices can always communicate with each other without problems. Any product
claiming conformance is required to list the facilities of the Standard which
it provides. Until such time that a list of parameter values for the control
function DEVICE ATTRIBUTES (7.2.17) is set up internationally, sender and
recipient of the data must check whether or not their own device can cope with
the other's implementation.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations which are inherent to its nature and to the aim
of fostering data interchange without standardizing equipment, it is believed
that this Standard gives strong guidance to device designers, avoiding the
development of incompatible hardware and helping to foster standardization.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#31-notational-convention" id="31-notational-convention">3.1. Notational Convention</a></h3>
<p>In this Standard a convention has been adopted to assist the reader. Capital
letters are used to refer to a specific control function, mode, mode setting,
or graphic character (whether they are defined in this Standard or in ISO 646).
This usage was found necessary in order to avoid confusion between the general
concepts and the specific encoded control functions, e.g. the concept 'space'
and the character SPACE (pos. 2/0).</p>
<p>Clause 7.2 lists the abbreviations, names and characteristics of the control
functions defined in this Standard. They are ordered according to the
alphabetic order of their abbreviations. It is intended that the abbreviations,
names and this convention be retained in all translations of the text.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#32-definition-of-terms" id="32-definition-of-terms">3.2. Definition of Terms</a></h3>
<p>In this Standard, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong>: A set of adjacent character positions in a visual display that are
not necessarily on the same line.</p>
<p><strong>Auxiliary device</strong>: A device connected to a character-imaging device for the
purpose of storing, retrieving, or imaging data.</p>
<p><strong>Character-imaging device</strong>: A device that gives a visual representation of
data in the form of graphic symbols using any technology, e.g. cathode ray tube
or printer.</p>
<p><strong>Character position</strong>: That portion of a visual display which is
imaging or is capable of imaging a graphic symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Control function</strong>: An action that affects the recording, processing,
transmission, or interpretation of data.</p>
<p><strong>Default</strong>: A value or a state that is to be assumed when no value or state is
explicitly specified.</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: A region for visual presentation of data on any type of
character-imaging device, including printer and cathode ray tube devices. A
display consists of a series of lines composed of character positions. In this
Standard the term display shall not be interpreted to mean a cathode ray tube
device exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>Field</strong>: An area whose boundaries are specified by horizontal tabulation
stops.</p>
<p><strong>Final character</strong>: A character whose bit combination terminates an escape
sequence or a control sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic rendition</strong>: A visual style of displaying a set of graphic symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate character:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A character whose bit combination occurs between the character ESCAPE and
the final character in an escape sequence consisting of more than two bit
combinations.</li>
<li>A character, other than a character in a parameter string, whose bit
combination occurs between the CONTROL SEQUENCE INTRODUCER and the final
character in a control sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Software that controls the execution of computer programs
and that may provide scheduling, debugging, input/output control, accounting,
compilation, storage assignment, data management, and related services.</p>
<p><strong>Private use</strong>: A means of representing a non-standardized control function in
a manner compatible with the Standard.</p>
<p><strong>Scroll</strong>: An action whereby all of the graphic symbols of a visual display
are moved in a specified direction.</p>
<p><strong>Tabulation</strong>: A technique of identifying character positions in a visual
display for the purpose of arranging information systematically.</p>
<p><strong>Tabulation stop</strong>: An indication that a character position is to be used for
tabulation; a horizontal tabulation stop may also serve as a boundary between
fields.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#4-coded-representations" id="4-coded-representations">4. CODED REPRESENTATIONS</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#41-general" id="41-general">4.1. General</a></h3>
<p>The set of additional control functions in this Standard consists of more than
32 control functions which can be coded in a C1 set.</p>
<p>Each control function belongs to one of the following cate-
gories, depending on the method of representation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control functions which are elements of the C1 set;</li>
<li>Control functions represented by control sequences;</li>
<li>Control functions represented by ESC Fs sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Standard also defines a method of representations of control functions by
means of control strings (see 4.6).</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#411-control-functions-which-are-elements-of-the-c1-set" id="411-control-functions-which-are-elements-of-the-c1-set">4.1.1. Control functions which are elements of the C1 set</a></h4>
<p>As in ECMA-35 such a control function is represented:</p>
<ul>
<li>in a 7-bit code by a 2-character escape sequence of the form ESC Fe, where Fe
is a bit combination of column 4 or 53</li>
<li>in an 8-bit code by a bit combination of column 08 or 09).</li>
</ul>
<p>This method of representation permits coding of up to 32 control functions.
These bit combinations are defined in 4.2</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#412-control-functions-represented-by-control-sequences" id="412-control-functions-represented-by-control-sequences">4.1.2. Control functions represented by control sequences</a></h4>
<p>A control sequence consists of the coded representation of CONTROL SEQUENCE
INTRODUCER (CSI) followed by one or more bit combinations which identify the
control function and, if applicable, represent the parameters of the control
function. The control function CSI itself is an element of the C1 set.</p>
<p>The format of a control sequence is:</p>
<pre><code>CSI P1 ... Pn I1 ... Im F
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSI is represented by ESC 5/11 in a 7-bit code and by 09/11 in an 8-bit code
(see 4.2).</li>
<li><code>P1</code> ... <code>Pn</code> are bit combinations of column 3 representing the parameter
values; these bit combinations shall be omitted if the control function has
no parameter, and may be omitted if the default parameter value is to apply.</li>
<li><code>I1</code> ... <code>Im</code> are bit combinations of column 2 which, together with the final
bit combination F, identify the control function; these bit combinations
shall be omitted if the control function is identified by the final bit
combination F alone;</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE 1: The number of intermediate bit combinations is not limited by this
Standard; in practice, at most one intermediate will be sufficient since over
one thousand control functions may be identified using not more than one
intermediate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F</code> is a bit combination of column 4, 5, 6 or 7 (except 7/15) which
terminates the control sequence and, together with the intermediate bit
combinations I1 ... Im, if present, identifies the control function (see 9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The occurrence of any bit combinations which do not conform to the above format
is an error condition for which recovery is not specified by this Standard.</p>
<p>The final bit combinations (either used alone or together with intermediates)
are classified in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The control functions identified by final bit combinations of columns 4, 5
and 6 are either standardized or reserved for future standardization;</li>
<li>the control functions identified by final bit combinations of column 7
(except 7/15) are not standardized and are available for private or
experimental use.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of parameters; numeric and selective (see 4.4). A numeric
parameter represents a number; a selective parameter merely represents a
character string, the meaning of which depends on the control function.</p>
<p>The final bit combinations of columns 4, 5 and 6 and the intermediate bit
combinations are defined in 4.3.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#44-parameter-representations" id="44-parameter-representations">4.4. Parameter Representations</a></h3>
<p>A control sequence may contain a string of bit combinations
<code>P1 ... Pn</code> representing one or more parameters to complete the
specification of the control function.</p>
<p>The string of bit combinations <code>P1 ... Pn</code> contained in a control sequence is
called the parameter string. It consists of bit combinations of column 3 and is
interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the first bit combination of the parameter string is in the range 3/0 to
3/11, the parameter string is interpreted according to the format described
below.</li>
<li>If the first bit combination of the parameter string is in the range 3/12 to
3/15, the parameter string is available for private or experimental use. Its
format and meaning are not specified in this Standard.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#441-parameter-string-format" id="441-parameter-string-format">4.4.1. Parameter string format</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A parameter string consists of one or more parameter substrings, each of
which represents a parameter value.</li>
<li>Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations from 3/0
to 3/9, representing the decimal digits ZERO to NINE.</li>
<li>Parameter sub-strings are separated by one bit combination 3/11.</li>
<li>Bit combination 3/10 is reserved for future standardization as an additional
parameter separator.</li>
<li>Bit combinations 3/12 to 3/15 shall not be used.</li>
<li>In each parameter sub-string, leading bit combinations 3/0 are not
significant and may be omitted.</li>
<li>If the parameter string starts with the bit combination 3/11, an empty
parameter sub-string is assumed preceding <code>|</code> the separator; if the parameter
string terminates with the bit combination 3/11, an empty parameter
sub-string is assumed following the separator; if the parameter string
contains successive bit combinations 3/11, empty parameter sub-strings are
assumed between the separators.</li>
<li>An empty parameter sub-string or a parameter sub-string which consists of bit

</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#442-types-of-parameters" id="442-types-of-parameters">4.4.2. Types of parameters</a></h4>
<p>There are two types of parameters: numeric parameters and selective parameters.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#4421-numeric-parameters" id="4421-numeric-parameters">4.4.2.1. Numeric parameters</a></h5>
<p>In a control sequence representing a control function with numeric parameters,
each parameter sub-string corresponds to one parameter.</p>
<p>The number of parameters is fixed and depends on the control function. If the
control function has more than one numeric parameter, and some (but not all)
parameter sub-strings are omitted, the separators (bit combination 3/11) must
still be present. Only if all parameter sub-strings are omitted, are the
separators not required.</p>
<p>Each numeric parameter sub-string which contains at least one bit combination
from 3/1 to 3/9 represents a number in decimal notation.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#4422-selective-parameters" id="4422-selective-parameters">4.4.2.2. Selective parameters</a></h5>
<p>In a control sequence representing a control function with a selective
parameter, each parameter sub-string represents one value of the selective
parameter. These values, whilst expressed by digits, are not quantitative. Each
corresponds to one of the actions the control function can perform. Neither the
maximum number of values nor the order in which the corresponding actions are
performed are prescribed by this Standard. The effect of a sequence of values
corresponding to conflicting actions depends on implementation.</p>
<p>A particular parameter value may have the same meaning as a combination of two

<h3><a class="header" href="#46-control-strings" id="46-control-strings">4.6. Control Strings</a></h3>
<p>A control string is a delimited string of characters which may occur in the
data stream as a logical entity for control purposes. A control string consists
of an opening delimiter, followed by a string of graphic characters and SPACEs
(bit combinations 2/0 to 7/14 inclusive) and terminated by STRING TERMINATOR
(ST). The occurrence of other bit combinations within a control string is an
error condition for which recovery is not specified by this Standard (see 9).</p>
<p>The opening delimiter indicates the class of the component of the system which
is the sender or recipient of the control string. The interpretation of the
contents of the control string is not specified by this Standard, but instead
requires prior agreement between the sender and the recipient of the data.</p>
<p>The classes of system components which can be specified by the appropriate
opening delimiter are the device, the operating system control program, the
privacy discipline, and the application program. The corresponding opening
delimiters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DEVICE CONTROL STRING (DCS)</li>
<li>OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND (OSC)</li>
<li>PRIVACY MESSAGE (PM)</li>
<li>APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND (APC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of applications of device control strings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>program loading</li>
<li>configuration control</li>
<li>mode control</li>
<li>diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of the use of application program command string is the interjection
of application program commands in a data stream or file being processed by the
application program as data.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#5-device-concepts" id="5-device-concepts">5. DEVICE CONCEPTS</a></h2>
<p>The definitions of the control functions in this Standard are based on general
assumptions about the architecture of character- imaging devices. Examples of
devices conforming to these concepts are: an alpha-numeric display device, a
printer or a microfilm output device.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#51-the-received-data-stream" id="51-the-received-data-stream">5.1. The Received Data Stream</a></h3>
<p>The received data stream is considered to be a continuous stream. It may be
structured in messages, records and/or blocks, but this does not affect the
operation of the device at the abstract level of description in this Standard;
the logical or physical units of data are regarded as being concatenated to
form a continuous stream.</p>
<p>The device may contain a buffer in which the received data are temporarily
stored before they are used to produce the character image output, or in which
the received data are permanently stored and continuously used to produce the
character image output.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#52-the-character-image-output" id="52-the-character-image-output">5.2. The Character Image Output</a></h3>
<p>The character image output may consist of one or more pages of a pre-determined
size.</p>
<p>A page is composed of a pre-determined number of lines, each being composed of
a number of character positions.</p>
<p>The device may have the capability of varying the number of lines per page, the
number of character positions per line, and the character spacing during the
operation of the device.</p>
<p>If the character image output is not structured in pages, it is regarded as
consisting of a single page of an unlimited number of lines.</p>
<p>The lines constituting a page as well as the character positions constituting a
line are identified by the natural numbers 1, 2, 3,</p>
<p>Each character position either is erased or images SPACE or a graphic symbol. A
graphic symbol represents a graphic character or one of the control functions
for which a graphic representation is required.</p>
<p>The initial state of all character positions is &quot;erased&quot;.</p>
<p>Depending on implementation, there may or may not be a distinction between an
erased character position and a character position imaging SPACE.</p>
<p>Depending on the characteristics of the device, a character position may be
capable of imaging a combination of two or more graphic symbols. This would
permit the use of BACKSPACE to generate accented letters or other composite
graphic symbols.</p>
<p>The width of a character position may be fixed or may depend on the character
being imaged.</p>
<p>In this Standard, the character image output is regarded as being produced in
the form of a continuous stream, but it may in actual fact be made available
character-by-character, line-by-line, or page-by-page.</p>
<p>The character positions are numbered relative to the character image (page)
output, not to the buffer (if any).</p>
<p>The character style and font design of the graphic symbols are not defined by
this Standard, but their shapes and relative positioning to accomodate overlay
of two or more symbols may be influenced by control functions in the received
data stream.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#53-the-active-position" id="53-the-active-position">5.3. The Active Position</a></h3>
<p>At any time, there is a unique character position which is called the &quot;active
position&quot;.</p>
<p>The active position is the character position which is to image the graphic
symbol representing the next graphic character of the received data stream or
the next control function for which a graphic representation is required. The
active position is also the reference position against which certain format
effectors or editor functions are performed (see 5.4).</p>
<p>The line containing the active position is called the &quot;active line&quot;.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#implicit-movement" id="implicit-movement">Implicit movement</a></h4>
<p>If the active position is not the last character position of a line, it is
moved to the following character position of the active line.</p>
<p>An implicit movement is performed when SPACE or a graphic character is received
or a control function, for which a graphic representation is required, is
executed.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#explicit-movement" id="explicit-movement">Explicit movement</a></h4>
<p>The active position is moved to a specified character position.</p>
<p>An explicit movement is performed when a control function is executed which
causes the active position to be moved to a specified position.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong>: In the case of an interactive display device it is common practice
to mark the active position by means of a special indicator which is called the
&quot;cursor&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 4</strong>: In the following situations, the effect of an attempt to move the
active position is not defined by this Standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>an attempt to perform an implicit movement when the active position is the
last character position of a line,</li>
<li>an attempt to perform an explicit movement to a non-existing character
position, e.g. beyond the last character position of a line, or beyond the
last line of a page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on implementation, an attempt to perform such an active
position movement may:</p>
<ul>
<li>cause a wrap around movement,</li>
<li>cause the active position to be blocked (a condition in which no graphic
symbol can be entered until a valid explicit active position movement is
performed),</li>
<li>cause the active position to remain where it is but permit graphic symbols to
be entered thereby replacing or overstriking the previously entered
character,</li>
<li>cause the cursor to disappear from the operator's view,</li>
<li>cause the cursor to move to the opposite end of the display but one row or
column offset,</li>
<li>cause scrolling to occur,</li>
<li>cause other implementation-dependent action.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#54-format-effectors-and-editor-functions" id="54-format-effectors-and-editor-functions">5.4. Format Effectors and Editor Functions</a></h3>
<p>Two classes of control functions have an action on the layout or positioning of
information in character-imaging devices.  They are format effectors and editor
functions. Format effectors are intended to be used on all classes of imaging
de- vices while editor functions are supplementary control functions required
only in circumstances for a certain class of devices where an action is to be
performed on previously entered data. The principal difference between editor
functions and format effectors is that the latter are sensitive to the FORMAT
EFFECTOR ACTION MODE, whereas the former are not (see Annex A).</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#541-format-effectors" id="541-format-effectors">5.4.1. Format effectors</a></h4>
<p>Format effectors belong to the data stream and shall be treated as data which
happen to have a format representation rather than a graphic representation.
Format effectors describe how the originator of the data stream wishes the
information to be formatted.</p>
<p>Therefore, if format effectors are not stored by the receiving device they
shall be regenerated by the device for subsequent transmission to additional
recipients in order to preserve data integrity.</p>
<p>Format effectors are processed as follows depending on the setting of the
FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (6.2.4) of the device.</p>
<p>If the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE is set to EXECUTE, the action specified by
the format effector (usually an active position movement) is immediately
performed. Depending on implementation a format effector may be stored in
addition to being performed.</p>
<p>If the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE is set to STORE, the format effector is
treated as a graphic and stored in the buffer. In this case, the specified
action is intended to be performed by an auxiliary input/output device when the
associated data are transferred.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#542-composite-characters" id="542-composite-characters">5.4.2. Composite characters</a></h4>
<p>Composite characters not already available shall be obtained using the format
effector BACKSPACE rather than editor functions (see Annex A.3). For example
small letter e with accent may be obtained as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Wez's note: this section is intended to show the use of BS to implement what
we refer to today as combining character display by printing accent characters
and then backspacing and printing latin characters, but it didn't translate
though the OCR.  This section needs fixing up</strong></p>

</tbody></table>
<h4><a class="header" href="#543-editor-functions" id="543-editor-functions">5.4.3. Editor functions</a></h4>
<p>The main purpose of editor functions is to edit, alter, or transpose the visual
arrangement of data.</p>
<p>In most cases, editor functions will be perfomed immediately by the first
receiver and then removed from the data stream.</p>
<p>Typical use of editor functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding of local functions for example encoding keyboard functions when the
keyboard is logically uncoupled from the output imaging mechanism of a
device.</li>
<li>Transposing intended representation to an alternate representation in those
cases where the receiving device is unable to display the intended image.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#55-editing-operations" id="55-editing-operations">5.5. Editing Operations</a></h3>
<p>This section is applicable primarily to buffered input/output devices. Editing
operations (erasure, deletion, and insertion) are performed either in execution
of control functions in the received data stream, or under control of a
keyboard or another manual entry device.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#551-erasure" id="551-erasure">5.5.1. Erasure</a></h4>
<p>The state of one or more character positions is changed to &quot;erased&quot;. Other
character positions remain unaffected.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#552-deletion" id="552-deletion">5.5.2. Deletion</a></h4>
<p>The data contained in one or more character positions are removed by shifting
the contents of an adjacent string of character positions so that the data to
be removed are overwritten. As a result a string of character positions, equal
in length to the deleted string, is erased at the beginning or the end of the
shifted part.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#553-insertion" id="553-insertion">5.5.3. Insertion</a></h4>
<p>One or more erased positions are inserted by shifting the contents of a string

<h4><a class="header" href="#561-selected-areas" id="561-selected-areas">5.6.1. Selected areas</a></h4>
<p>A selected area is a string of character positions, the
contents of which may be eligible (see 6.3) to be transmitted in the form of a
data stream or to be transferred to an auxiliary input/output device (see 5.7).</p>
<p>The beginning of a selected area is established by START OF SELECTED AREA
(SSA). The character position which is the active position after receipt of SSA
is the first character position of the selected area.</p>
<p>The end of a selected area is established by END OF SELECTED AREA (ESA). The
character position which is the active position before receipt of ESA is the
last character position of the selected area.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#562-qualified-areas" id="562-qualified-areas">5.6.2. Qualified areas</a></h4>
<p>A qualified area is a string of character positions with which certain
characteristics are associated, such as one or a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the contents of the character positions are protected against manual
alteration;</li>
<li>the set of characters which are permitted to be entered is restricted (e.g.
to numeric or alphabetic characters only);</li>
<li>the character positions are protected against erasure;</li>
<li>a tabulation stop is associated with the first character position;</li>
<li>the character positions are to be excluded, i.e. guarded (see 5.6.2.2) from
transmission of a data stream, or from transfer to an auxiliary input/output
device (see 5.7).</li>
</ul>
<p>The beginning of a qualified area is established by DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION
(DAQ). The character position which is the active position after receipt of DAQ
is the first character position of the qualified area. The type of area
qualification is specified by the parameter of DAQ. The end of a qualified area
is established by the beginning of the following qualified area.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#5621-protected-area" id="5621-protected-area">5.6.2.1. Protected area</a></h5>
<p>A protected area is a special case of a qualified area.  It is a string of
character positions, the contents of which are protected against manual
alteration. A protected area may, in general, be either guarded or unguarded.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#5622-guarded-area" id="5622-guarded-area">5.6.2.2. Guarded area</a></h5>
<p>A guarded area is a special case of a qualified area. It is a protected area
which is to be excluded from transmission of a data stream and from transfer to
an auxiliary input/output device.</p>
<p>An alternative way to establish the beginning and end of a guarded protected
area is by means of START OF PROTECTED AREA (SPA) and END OF PROTECTED AREA
(EPA).</p>

<p>This section is applicable primarily to buffered input/output devices. It may
be also applicable to unbuffered input/output devices when the SEND/RECEIVE
MODE is set to SIMULTANEOUS.</p>
<p>Data transfer from or to an auxiliary input/output device is initiated either
by the operation of an appropriate button on a keyboard or by the control
function MEDIA COPY (MC) appearing in the received data stream.</p>
<p>If there are more than one auxiliary input/output devices, the relevant device
is specified by the parameter of MC.</p>
<p>An input data stream which is received from an auxiliary device is processed in
the same way as any other received data stream. The method of terminating the
input from the auxiliary device depends on implementation.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#61-the-concept-of-modes" id="61-the-concept-of-modes">6.1. The Concept of Modes</a></h3>
<p>This Standard is intended to be applicable to a very large range of devices.
Within that broad range it is recognized that variations exist. Some of these
variations have been formalized in this Standard in the form of modes. They
deal with the way in which a device transmits, receives, processes, or images
data. Each mode is defined as having two states. The initial state of each mode
is defined by the implementation.</p>
<p>The modes may be established explicitly within the data stream or by agreement
between sender and recipient. In an implementation, some or all of the modes
may have a fixed state incapable of being altered.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#62-definition-of-modes" id="62-definition-of-modes">6.2. Definition of Modes</a></h3>
<p>The modes listed below are defined in this Standard. They are set and reset by
the control functions SET MODE (SM) and RESET MODE (RM). The parameter of SM or
RM specifies the mode which is affected. In each of the mode definitions below,
the first state is caused by RM, the second one by SM.</p>

<p>The control functions defined in this Standard can be coded in a 7-bit code as
well as in an 8-bit code; both forms of coded representation are equivalent and
in accordance with ECMA-35.</p>
<p>However, when data containing these control functions are transformed from a
7-bit to an 8-bit coded representation or vice versa, the transformation
algorithm specified in ECMA-35 may produce results which are formally in
disagreement with this Standard.</p>
<p>In order to make allowance for such unintended but unavoidable deviations, the
format rules are extended in the manner described below.</p>
<p>In an 8-bit code, the bit combinations of columns 10 to 15 (except 10/0 and
15/15) are permitted to represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>parameters, intermediates and finals of a control sequence;</li>
<li>the contents of a control string;</li>
<li>the operand of a single-shift character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these situations, the bit combinations in the range 10/1 to 15/14 have the
same meanings as the corresponding bit combinations in the range 2/1 to 7/14.</p>
<p>In a 7-bit code, the control characters SHIFT-OUT (SO) and SHIFT-IN (SI) are
permitted to occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>between the CONTROL SEQUENCE INTRODUCER (CSI) and the final bit combination
of a control sequence;</li>
<li>between the opening delimiter of a control string and the STRING TERMINATOR (ST);</li>
<li>between a single-shift character and its operand.</li>
</ul>
<p>SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN have no effect on the interpretation of a control
sequence, a control string or the operand of a single-shift character, but they
may indeed affect the meanings of bit combinations following in the data
stream.</p>

<p>In the example it is assumed that the string of capital letters:</p>
<pre><code>A B C D E F
</code></pre>
<p>has been entered or received, and that the active position has been moved back
to the letter <code>D</code>, e.g. by-means of CURSOR BACKWARDS (CUB). Starting from this
situation, the following cases are considered.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>: A CURSOR NEXT LINE (CNL) is received. In this case, the active
position is moved to the beginning of the next line without affecting the
previously received data.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>: The FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE being set to EXECUTE, a NEXT LINE
(NEL) is received. This has the same effect as in case 1).</p>
<p><strong>Case 3</strong>: The FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE being set to STORE and the
INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE to REPLACE, a NEXT LINE (NEL) is received. In this
case, the letter D is replaced by NEL.  If the data is subsequently forwarded
to another device operating with the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE being set to
EXECUTE, the effect is:</p>
<pre><code>A B C
E F
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Case 4</strong>: The FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE being set to STORE and the
INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE to INSERT, a NEXT LINE (NEL) is received. In this
case, the NEL is inserted between the letters C and D. If the data is
subsequently forwarded to another device operating with the FORMAT EFFECTOR
ACTION MODE being set to EXECUTE, the effect is:</p>
<pre><code>A B C
D E F
</code></pre>
<p>Format effectors which have been received while the FORMAT
EFFECTOR ACTION MODE is set to STORE can be operated upon with
editing functions.</p>
<p>For example, the NEL which has been inserted between A B C and
D E F in case 4) can be deleted using DELETE CHARACTER
(DCH), resulting in the initial situation being restored.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#a3-composite-graphic-characters" id="a3-composite-graphic-characters">A.3 Composite graphic characters</a></h3>
<p>Because the format effectors can be stored in a receiving device, as opposed to
the editor functions which are immediately performed, format effectors rather
than editor functions should be used for the construction of composite
graphics.</p>
<p>For example, if the symbol <tt>≠</tt> is to be composed using <code>=</code> (EQUALS SIGN) and <code>/</code>
(SOLIDUS), the sequence:</p>
<pre><code>= CUB /
</code></pre>
<p>does not produce the desired effect if received by a device which has no
overstrike capability. Such a device may, however, process the sequence:</p>
<pre><code>= BS /
</code></pre>
<p>in such a way that it is preserved and can be forwarded to a device which can
indeed produce the intended composite symbol.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-c-text-composition-device-concepts" id="appendix-c-text-composition-device-concepts">APPENDIX C TEXT COMPOSITION DEVICE CONCEPTS</a></h2>
<p>Display devices and systems involving text composition may utilize the control
functions JUSTIFY and QUAD. When working in the field of text composition
several words are used with quite specialized meaning. Those words have been
used in this Standard with the meaning from the terminology of the printing and
publishing industry.  Explanation is provided in this Annex in terms compatible
with coded information interchange and the concepts of character-imaging
devices.</p>
<p>Both QUAD and JUSTIFY deal with the positioning of text (printed graphics and
free spaces) between &quot;margins&quot;. Margins are areas protected against display at
the boundaries of which lines of text may start and terminate. In the general
case of a display device with a multiple-page buffer (capable of the QUAD or
JUSTIFY functions) the margin(s) would be set at arbitrary absolute horizontal
positions. No control functions are provided in this Standard to set margins
(left, right, intermediate). The QUAD function deals with single lines of text
from the data stream, while the JUSTIFY function may deal with more than one
line. In both cases it is possible to &quot;flush&quot; text. When text is flush, it
starts or ends, as applicable, against a marginal boundary. Flush to left
margin means start text at the left margin (or first margin to the left in
columnar texts). Similarly, flush to right margin means end text at the right
margin. In the process of making text flush, open spaces may be generated.</p>
<p>The action to &quot;fill&quot; open spaces involves a concept particular to the JUSTIFY
and QUAD functions. The open spaces may be filled with a &quot;leader&quot; in the QUAD
function. A leader is a pattern (most often a repeated string of graphic
characters) which is inserted into the open area. In the use of the JUSTIFY
function the fill operation is far more complicated and will be described
below.</p>
<p>Having considered margins and flush text it is necessary to consider text which
is not intended to be flush to the margins. Text which meets this criterion
falls into two categories. They are centred text and ragged text. This Standard
deals explicitly with centred text and implicitly with ragged text. Centred
text is arranged between margins such that the open space to the left and right
margin are as equal as possible. Ragged is the term applied when text is
neither centred nor flush to a margin.</p>
<p>The process utilizing the JUSTIFY function involves the arrangement of text
between margins either being flush (explicitly) or ragged (implicitly). In
order to accomplish flush left and right, fill may be required. The fill may
consist of SPACEs, Thin Spaces, words, or part of words. For the purposes of
this description a word is considered as including the graphic characters of
the word itself and the punctuation or space terminating the word. The rules
regarding a specific justification process depend on the combination of the
parameter values used. A line which is to be justified left and right with word
fill will first be adjusted in length by the addition or removal of text in the
form of words until the remaining words fit between the established margins.
Words added to a line by such a process will be obtained from the data stream
from its following line(s). Words removed from the line will be returned to the
data stream in its following line(s). Subsequent to having sufficient words to
fit between margins the open space (between words) may be adjusted to
accomplish the combined flush-to-left-margin and flush to-right-margin action.
This ‘spacing is adjusted by the intervals, or variable-size spaces according
to the implementation. When the interword space parameter value has been used,
the spacing adjustment is applicable between words. When the letter space
parameter value has been used the spacing adjustment is applicable between
adjacent graphic characters. When either or both interword space and letter
space parameter values have been used the strategy for selecting which
positions are to be widened is implementation-dependent.  Special cases of the
above involve the use of partial words in the full process. In these cases a
hyphenation process is used. If the hyphenation parameter value is used, words
may be subdivided according to an implementation strategy at language intervals
often corresponding to syllables. If the Italian hyphenation parameter value is
used the first word which will not fit between the margins is truncated, the
last character of the line is underlined and the remainder of the word is
inserted in the data stream for use in the next line.</p>

<li>What the representation of an erased state may be.</li>
<li>Whether certain control sequences remain in their encoded state or are
transformed into data in special registers and tables.</li>
<li>Whether or not there are implementation-defined values for parametric
functions when the Standard does not specify a standardized default
value.</li>
<li>What action will be taken in error recovery.</li>
<li>The initial state of a device upon power-up, including the settings of
the modes.</li>
<li>Whether the width of a displayed character position is fixed or variable
(depending on the character occupying the position).</li>
<li>The action to be taken by a device if a control function or a graphic
character is received which the device cannot implement, because of design
limitation or temporary functional disablement.</li>
<li>Whether a change of the setting of the CONTROL REPRESENTATION MODE affects
the appearance of control functions already entered into, or received by,
the device or whether only those entered or received subsequently.</li>
<li>Whether or not the characters in an eligible area are transmitted in
the data stream or transferred to an auxiliary device when the eligible
area begins in the middle of a guarded area.</li>
