## BRIEF HISTORY

After having issued its Standard ECMA-35 for the extension of the 7-bit coded
character set, the coding committee TC 1 of ECMA set up a task group with a
view to developing a set of additional control functions. This work was
conducted in close co-operation with the coding committee X3L2 of ANSI.
Intermediate results were periodically discussed at the meetings of
I1SO/TC97/SC2. The first edition of Standard ECMA-48 was issued in September
1976.

In ISO/TC97/SC2 a working party developed an ISO Draft Proposal based on
ECMA-48 and on the contributions presented by the representatives of X3L2.
Several versions were drafted, submitted to SC2 and up-dated according to the
comments received. Finally, at its May 1978 meeting, SC2 adopted the final text
which will be processed as a draft international standard and eventually issued
as ISO 6429.

This 2nd edition of ECMA-48 is based on the text of DIS 6429 and is technically
identical with it. It has been accepted as an ECMA Standard by the General
Assembly of ECMA on June 21, 1979.

THIS 2nd EDITION SUPERSEDES THE VERSION DATED SEPTEMBER 1976.

few OCR transcription issues.  Aside from the format/layout adjustments
required to bring this document to a searchable and linkable form, there are no
intentional textual changes.
